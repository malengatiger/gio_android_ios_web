Offering a monthly or annual subscription model for a cloud-based field worker collaboration and management solution can be a cost-effective solution for clients who want to improve their monitoring capabilities. The subscription model can provide clients with access to powerful tools and features, such as real-time multimedia sharing, a centralized command post, real-time notifications, and multimedia timelines, for a relatively low monthly expense. This can help clients to reduce the costs associated with traditional manual processes and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations. Additionally, by offering the service as a subscription model, the company can have the option to hire young people and students to perform digital field work, providing them with valuable experience and training. Overall, the subscription model can provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for clients, while also providing opportunities for young people and students to gain hands-on experience in the field.
